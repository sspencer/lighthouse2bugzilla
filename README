These scripts work in conjunction to move export bugs from LightHouse and import them into Bugzilla.
The export script creates a JSON file.  The import script creates a SQL file.

lighthouse_dumper.rb pulls gunk outta lighthouse using their web api, resulting in a json database
of your bugs

import.php pushes that gunk into bugzilla

Much has to be customized with the scripts.

Good luck.

* hacky
* you gotta manually move attachments over.
